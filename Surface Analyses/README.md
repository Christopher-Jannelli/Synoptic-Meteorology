## obs_sounding.ipynb
A function plot_sounding that retrieves, processes, and visualizes atmospheric sounding data on a Skew-T diagram. A Skew-T diagram is commonly used in meteorology to analyze the thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere. Here's a breakdown of what this script does:

## sfc_map.ipynb
This script demonstrates how to create a surface observation plot using the MetPy Declarative Plotting Interface. It organizes a workflow to retrieve and plot meteorological surface observations (METAR data) on a map. 

## sfc_Map_WX_Disc.ipynb
This script processes and visualizes surface weather observations using METAR data, formatted and displayed on a map.

## upa_map.ipynb
This script is designed to visualize upper-air (UPA) observations at the 500 hPa pressure level using the MetPy library. 

## 
This script processes meteorological data from the NAM (North American Mesoscale) model and a GEMPAK grid file for visualization.
