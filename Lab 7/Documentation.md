This code is for processing and visualizing meteorological data using the MetPy library, primarily working with GEMPAK grid data files.
Designed to read GEMPAK data for a specific time and pressure levels, process the data with MetPy (including smoothing, geostrophic wind calculation, and advection), and generate a series of contour plots on a map to visualize meteorological phenomena such as temperature advection, geostrophic wind, and vorticity advection at different atmospheric levels. The final output is a multi-panel map showing these calculated fields.
