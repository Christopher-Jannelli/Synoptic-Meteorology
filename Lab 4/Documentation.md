## lab4_problem3.ipynb
This Python code is focused on creating meteorological visualizations by analyzing wind, pressure, and divergence fields using GFS data. It utilizes MetPy for meteorological calculations and visualizations and xarray for data handling. The visualizations are laid out on a set of four panels with different types of plots, including wind barbs, divergence contours, and isallobars.

## lab4final_challenge.ipynb
This Python code is focused on retrieving GEMPAK (GEM) data, performing basic atmospheric calculations, and visualizing the results using MetPy. The code performs multiple types of visualizations such as contour plots, filled contour plots, and wind barbs. It also uses a custom module to retrieve data from a specific forecast model. The code walks through different visualization examples using 500-mb and 1000-mb heights, temperatures, winds, and calculations like advection and vorticity.
