This code performs a series of steps to analyze and visualize meteorological data from a GEMPAK file, specifically focusing on 300-hPa heights, potential vorticity (PV), and ageostrophic winds.
This script visualizes meteorological dynamics at the 300-hPa level, highlighting:
  - Geopotential heights.
  - Positive and negative PV patterns.
  - Atmospheric divergence fields (via ageostrophic winds, if computed).

## lab3_p3.ipynb
This code generates a plot displaying 500-mb geopotential heights, wind speed, and wind vectors using GFS model data. 
Produces a plot of 500-hPa geopotential heights, wind speed, and wind vectors (represented as wind barbs) over a specified region and time. It visualizes meteorological features like wind patterns and atmospheric pressure at the 500 hPa level, which are useful for analyzing mid-tropospheric weather systems.
